    <h1>Privacy Policy for <strong>Wordly</strong></h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> November 15, 2025</p>
  </header>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Wordly</strong> (the "App") collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you use the mobile application published on Google Play. By installing or using the App you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

  <h2>1. Summary — short version</h2>
  <p>We do not require you to create an account to play. The App is designed to work primarily with data stored locally on your device. We may collect limited device and usage information to provide analytics, crash reporting, and advertisements (if enabled). We do not intentionally collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or other direct personal identifiers in normal gameplay.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Action for developer:</strong> Replace contact email and any SDK placeholders below with the actual values used by your app before publishing.
  </div>

  <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
  <p>We collect the following categories of data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local game data</strong> — Your puzzle progress, in‑game settings, scores and achievements are stored locally on your device unless you enable cloud backup (see below).</li>
    <li><strong>Device & technical data</strong> — Device model, operating system version, app version, language/locale, screen size and basic diagnostics (crash logs, performance metrics).</li>
    <li><strong>Identifiers</strong> — Advertising identifiers such as Google Advertising ID (GAID) may be accessed by third‑party ad and analytics SDKs. We do not link advertising identifiers to personal contact information in the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics & crash reporting</strong> — Aggregate and anonymous usage metrics and crash reports to help us improve the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Ads data</strong> (if ads enabled) — Third‑party advertising networks may collect device identifiers and technical signals to serve and measure ads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How we collect information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Automatically:</strong> Device & usage data are collected automatically by the App and/or third‑party SDKs.</li>
    <li><strong>Locally:</strong> Game progress and settings are stored on your device by default.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud backup (optional):</strong> If you enable an optional cloud backup feature (for example to transfer progress between devices), your backup will be stored in a secure cloud storage service — details shown on the backing screen. Enabling backup is optional and requires your explicit confirmation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Purpose of collection</h2>
  <p>We use collected data for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To operate and maintain the App.</li>
    <li>To analyze usage patterns, diagnose crashes, and improve features (analytics & crash reporting).</li>
    <li>To show advertisements (if enabled) and measure ad performance.</li>
    <li>To provide optional cloud backup and restore of game progress when you enable it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Third‑party services and SDKs</h2>
  <p>The App uses third‑party services that may collect, store and process certain information. Typical SDKs used by mobile apps include analytics, crash reporting, and ad networks. Current examples (replace with the exact SDKs your app uses):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Firebase (Analytics & Crashlytics) — <em>analytics and crash reporting</em></li>
    <li>Google AdMob — <em>advertising</em></li>
    <li>Google Play Services — <em>various platform integrations</em></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data sharing and disclosure</h2>
  <p>We may share non‑personal and aggregate data with service providers that support the App (for analytics, ads, crash reporting). We do not sell your personal data. Any sharing of data with third parties is limited to what is necessary for the service provided (for example, passing device identifiers to an ad network so it can serve ads).</p>

  <h2>7. Ads and advertising identifiers</h2>
  <p>If the App displays advertisements, third‑party ad networks may show ads and collect device identifiers and usage data to personalize and measure ads. You can opt out of interest‑based ads on your device via the system settings (Android: Ads Settings / Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization). We do not control the data collection performed by ad networks; please review their policies for details.</p>

  <h2>8. Permissions</h2>
  <p>The App requests only the permissions necessary for the gameplay and features. Typical minimal permissions include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>INTERNET</code> — required to load ads, sync optional backup, and check for updates.</li>
    <li><code>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</code> — to determine online status.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If your build requests additional permissions (storage, microphone, camera, location), list them here and explain why they are required. If your app does not request any extra permissions, you can state: "No optional runtime permissions (camera, microphone or location) are requested by the App."</p>

  <h2>9. Data retention & deletion</h2>
  <p>Local game data remains on your device until you delete the App or clear the App's data. For data kept by third‑party services (analytics or ad networks), retention is governed by the third‑party's policies. If you enable cloud backups, backups will be retained until you delete them or disable the backup feature.</p>
  <p><strong>To request deletion:</strong> Contact us at the email address below and provide the device details and description of the data you want removed. We will respond to verifiable requests to access, correct, or delete your data within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

  <h2>10. Children</h2>
  <p>The App is not specifically directed to children under 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that a child under the applicable age
